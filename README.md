# **TETR.IO Connected Skin Generator**
Generate a Tetr.io connected skin from minimal input as possible. You only had to draw each piece of mino and garbage to generate connected skin.

You're still required to use [TETR.IO PLUS](https://gitlab.com/UniQMG/tetrio-plus) to be able to use skins.

# Tutorial Video
Coming soon

# Usage Guide
If you don't fancy installing python yourself or are unfamiliar with python, you may try using one of the executables that are available on the [releases](https://github.com/Trisnox/tetrio-connected-skin-generator/releases) tab, just run the executable and follow/input the interactive message, simple as that.

Linux was packaged on WSL using pyinstaller and never tested before since I don't use any linux os, I can't guarantee if this works for you.

Otherwise follow along this guide.

# Running from source
## Requirements
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7+
- [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

## Installation
After you downloaded python, make sure to check [Add Python to PATH](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/558246912982122526/990973262999744522/unknown.png) before installation.

After python is installed on your machine, open command prompt and type:
```
pip install pillow
```

And then, download this repository as zip. [If you don't know how to](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/558246912982122526/990994256862789662/unknown.png)

## Usage
Assuming you already created your skin from the template that I provided and have installed python, simply type:
```
[windows] python main.py
[linux]   python3 main.py
```
on the current folder where this script is located. A GUI will then appear.

# Name Keys
Skin files should be named correctly in order for the script to detect and use them, it only support `.png` and `.jpg` formats. Here are the list of name keys.

| Method | Essential | Optional | Input | Output | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Universal | `s` `t` `o` `i` | `singular` `3x3` | ![input](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/558246912982122526/991660115151302666/quilt.png) | ![chunk.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/558246912982122526/991660114635391047/result.png) | `3x3` will be used for garbage, otherwise, it will use `o` and `i`.<br />All images must be symmetrical and identical, garbage is not required to be identical but requires symmetrical<br />After the image is generated, you had to color and merge the result/garbage on your own.<br />Singular is not yet supported for this one. |
| Standard | `s` `z` `l` `j` `t` `o` `i` `gb` `gbd`  | `s_singular` `z_singular` `l_singular` `j_singular` `t_singular` `o_singular` `i_singular` `gb_singular` `gbd_singular` `u_disabled` | ![input](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/558246912982122526/991660772759445564/quilt.png) | ![result_1x.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/558246912982122526/991653621206896691/result_1x.png) | `u-disabled` is a chunk that was generated by the `Universal` method, you can use this result for the disabled, otherwise, one will be generated depending on the choice that you picked.<br />Each pieces/images must be symmetrical.<br />Each minos may have different variation.<br />After the result is exported, click the `Merge` button to merge the disabled with the skin, it will check from export folder first, then the skin location.<br />Singular is not yet supported for this one. |
| Advanced | - | - | - | - | Symmetric and identic are not needed for this method.<br />Singular won't be generated if not provided.|

# GUI info
## Generate
Generate skin based on the skin location and options that you selected.

## Merge
Merge `result.png` and `disabled.png`, by default this uses export location instead of the skin location.

## Skin Generation Method
By default, this uses automatic, which guess what kind of skin you are trying to export by preserving file names. Refer to the [name keys](https://github.com/Trisnox/tetrio-connected-skin-generator#name-keys) for more info on each method.

## Disabled Generation
Wherever to generate or use flat color for disabled mino. This option is ignored for universal and standard (if you have `u_disabled` file).

## Export 1x
Small QOL as TETR.IO PLUS fails to import if you try to drag and drop the 2x file.

# Help
If you require further assistance, you can contact me through my discord (KÂ·#4963) or any [social media](https://web.tris07.repl.co/) that I had.

# to-do
- Advanced connected skin generation which consists of 1-4 image pieces per mino for better result.
- Since the way how singular block (1x1) generated was messy, it would be wise to make it as optional input.
- Possibly a web.

# Notes
GUI will autofill the `Skin location` if there's only a single folder inside the directory. This, however, does not have checks unlike the CLI version.

Some part of the skin were intentionally left empty because only couple portion are visible when rotated/skimmed.

I was using Python 3.8 and Pillow 9.1.1 for this script, result might differ if you use a lower version than this. This isn't the case if you used the executable.
